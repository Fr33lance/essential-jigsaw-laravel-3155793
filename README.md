You may know that Jigsaw is a framework used to rapidly build static sites, but did you know that it’s also a great solution for PHP and Laravel developers? That’s because Jigsaw uses the Blade templating engine, which is the same engine used in Laravel. Join Zuzana Kunckova for an overview of Jigsaw that’s uniquely designed for developers and DevOps engineers who work with PHP and Laravel.

Discover how to install Jigsaw, as well as choose and install an official template that fits the particular needs of your users. Take a tour of the entire codebase. Learn more about how to create and edit content, and how to deploy your website for free on Netlify. Find out why Jigsaw is one of the best PHP-based static site generators out there—and consider what it can do for you and your team.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:
